At the Apple Developer Academy, I’ve worked on real-world, community-focused apps like **Developer Academy** and **HealthCardAI**, while collaborating with multidisciplinary teams. I also participated in the The Apple Developer Academy program in Naples, Italy and plan to use these experiences to build inclusive and impactful apps for society.

✅ Full Stack Development using Java, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, JS, and MySQL

## 📚 What else?

I have a strong foundation in core Java and backend technologies. In the future, I aim to return to India to support Geobull Innovations LLP and eventually launch my own tech startup that leverages the advanced skills I’ve learned at the Academy to make a real difference in my community.
